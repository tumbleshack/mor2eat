# mor2eat

mor2eat is an application of Yan's algorithm to find the maximum ordered list of Chick Fil A's visitable under a time constraint. 

# Why?

I want to visit more Chick Fil A's than anyone ever has before. To do this, I need an optmial route (most CFA's, one day). Would it be easier to manually look at Google maps and construct one?

Probably.

But that's not as fun. Let's find the absolute, mathematically most optimal route ðŸ˜Ž

# General Intuition

Make a graph, where Chick Fil A's are nodes and directed, weighted edges between them represent the Google Maps estimated travel time. For practical concerns, the graph is not fully connected. Rather, only CFA's within about 35 miles of each other are connected.

Once the graph is built, repeatedly run Dijkstra's algorithm between a source and sink node to find the n shortest paths (in order). This process is known as Yan's algorithm. Of all paths under a certaint time, say 15.5 hours, find the one with the most nodes.

Run Yan's algorithm for all possible pairs of source/sink nodes, and again find the path with maximum nodes. Let's take that one.

# Time

Yan's runs in polynomial time, and we'll run it N^2 time. So while this algorithm is still polynomial, it's gonna be pretty darn slow. But that's okay, there's no rush.

# Practical Concerns

Stopping at CFA's is not instantaneous. We'll estimate a 10 minute average time spent at each CFA. We'll encode this in edge weights, where the weight of edge `e = (u,v) = driving_minutes_from_u_to_v + 10`.
